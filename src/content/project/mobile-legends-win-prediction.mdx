## 🧠 Project Summary:

I developed a machine learning-based prediction system to estimate team win probability in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, a popular MOBA mobile game. The system utilized the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify and calculate the winning likelihood of a team based on hero composition and several critical factors such as role synergy and build strategies.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Tools:** MATLAB
- **Algorithms:** Naive Bayes

## 🔍 Key Objectives:
	•	Help players understand win potential based on their team’s composition.
	•	Provide a decision support system for better hero selection and strategy planning.
	•	Highlight the importance of teamwork, hero mastery, and item builds in ranked matches.

## 🛠 What I Did:
	•	Collected and labeled gameplay data from 30 real matches.
	•	Identified key loss factors: poor team composition, incorrect item builds, and lack of hero mastery.
	•	Applied the Naive Bayes classification algorithm to calculate win probabilities.
	•	Created a user interface (as a prototype) where users input team composition and receive win chance predictions.
	•	Modeled user flow using Use Case Diagrams to capture system requirements.

## 📊 Outcome:
	•	Built a lightweight and educational prediction tool that served as a guide for strategic gameplay.
	•	Demonstrated how machine learning could enhance user decision-making in competitive games.
	•	The project received strong academic feedback and showcased the applicability of data science in game environments.

## 🧩 Challenges:
	•	Limited dataset (30 matches) required thoughtful data preparation and assumption handling.
	•	Translating complex in-game variables into measurable and meaningful inputs for the model.

## 📁 Deliverables:
	•	Complete dataset and preprocessing scripts.
	•	Functional prototype of the prediction system.
	•	Final report and academic presentation.
