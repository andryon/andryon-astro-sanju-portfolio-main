## üß† Project Summary
The Hoka-Hoka Bento Inventory Management System is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to streamline and optimize the stock management operations for Hoka-Hoka Bento restaurants in Surabaya. This system addresses the critical challenge of efficiently tracking, managing, and distributing inventory across multiple restaurant locations, ensuring optimal stock levels while minimizing waste and operational costs.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement
Hoka-Hoka Bento, a popular Japanese fast-food chain, faced significant challenges in managing their inventory across multiple locations:
- Manual inventory tracking led to inconsistencies and errors

- Inefficient request and fulfillment processes for stock replenishment
- Difficulty in tracking vehicle fleet for deliveries
- Limited reporting capabilities for management decision-making

## üíª Tech Stack
### Backend
- PHP 7.x : Core programming language
- CodeIgniter 3 : MVC framework for structured development
- MySQL : Relational database management system
### Frontend
- HTML5/CSS3 : For structure and styling
- JavaScript/jQuery : For interactive elements
- AdminLTE : Admin dashboard template based on Bootstrap
- Bootstrap : Frontend framework for responsive design
### Additional Libraries
